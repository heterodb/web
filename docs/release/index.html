HeteroDB released PG-Strom products for GPU acceleration of database workloads
</h1>

<p class="headline">
18-Apr-2018 (Wed)
</p>

<p>Today, HeteroDB,Inc (Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan, CEO: KaiGai Kohei) released subscription products of PG-Strom which is GPU accelerated database technology, and appliance server product with this software.</p>
<h2 id="pg-strom-which-pull-out-maximum-capability-of-the-least-hardware-offers-dwh-class-performance-with-1u2u-rack-server">PG-Strom which pull out maximum capability of the least hardware, offers DWH-class performance with 1U/2U rack server.</h2>
<p>PG-Strom is an extension module designed for PostgreSQL which is one of the most successful open source relational database management system. It automatically generates GPU programs from SQL commands, and runs SQL workloads in parallel using a few thousand cores and high-bandwidth memory of GPU, so accelerates reporting and analytics workloads to big-data.</p>
<p><img alt="SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL" src="../img/press_20180418b.png" /></p>
<p>SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution, a part of core features, directly loads data blocks of PostgreSQL on NVMe-SSD to GPU, then runs SQL workloads on the GPU prior to the data arrival at the host system. It enables to reduce amount of the data to be processed by CPU less than a few hundredth of the original, thus runs I/O intensive workloads like reporting queries or full-table scans much efficiently.</p>
<p><img alt="Extension of PostgreSQL" src="../img/press_20180418c.png" /></p>
<p>PG-Strom is implemented on top of the internal APIs officially supported by PostgreSQL only, so it looks like a vanilla PostgreSQL system from the standpoint of users and applications. No special tuning and configurations are needed because its optimizer determines whether GPU shall be utilized according to the characteristics of the query. In addition, it can perform on transactional data (row-format) also, no need to convert the data format between transactional system and information system.</p>
<p>By the enhancement of sufficient performance to single node PostgreSQL which is the simplest configuration, it allows to design application more and more simple, and also allows to reduce daily database administration jobs.</p>
<h2 id="appliance-model-optimized-for-pg-strom">Appliance model optimized for PG-Strom</h2>
<p>We simultaneously release an appliance server product which consists of optimal hardware components and validated as a platform of the various acceleration features of PG-Strom.</p>

</h1>

<p class="headline">
4-Jul-2017 (Tue)
</p>

<p>Today, KaiGai Kohei and Kashiwagi Takehiko, who are core members of PG-Strom Development Team, established HeteroDB,Inc. The new company will provides high performance, cost effective and well administrative database product that utilizes heterogeneous computing technology, and related solution and services.</p>
<h2 id="mission-of-the-new-company">Mission of the new company</h2>
<p>We are living in an exciting period when computer architecture is rapidly evolving once per decade. The Moore's law comes closer to its termination, processor is evolved from multi-cores to many-cores, and it becomes almost impossible to improve system performance without GPU or FPGA that are designed based on a different design concept. In case of the heterogeneous computer architecture, software cannot take a "free-lunch" of hardware evolution. Software has to be redesigned to pull out maximum performance of the hardware.</p>
<p>We have worked on development of "PG-Strom" which is an open source extension module to accelerate SQL workloads of PostgreSQL with GPU's parallel computing capability for more than 5 years. It is a quite exciting technology area from the standpoint of software developer. Plus, we have been supported by our vocation to deliver the power of heterogeneous computing that is a core of next generation computer architecture, through the database management system that widely supports human and society, and also through the eco-system of open source software.</p>
<p>HeteroDB,Inc we established today has the following three missions.</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide high-performance, cost-effective and well-administrative data processing platform, by the database product that embeds heterogeneous computing technology like PG-Strom.</li>
<li>To be a professional on both of GPU and database; different technology areas, and to lead an optimal solution based on the insight to customer's problem.</li>
<li>To contribute growth of eco-system of the open source community beyond companies, nations and technology areas, and to make our widespread innovation to the upstream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all, we are a company who makes exciting technologies products, and a company to contribute our society's improvement through the solutions towards user's problems by modern approach.</p>

<p>This research introduces the concept, technology overview and benchmark results of the SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution feature which is one of the core functionalities of our HeteroServer product. It presents GPU devices, usually considered as an accelerator of computing intensive workloads, are also capable to work upon I/O intensive workloads using our application of GPUDirect RDMA. It is utilized to filter out unnecessary data, or to execute JOIN/GROUP BY in the middle of data flow.</p>
