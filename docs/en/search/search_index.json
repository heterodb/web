This software is designed for acceleration of terabytes and billions-rows scale data processing, summarizing and analytics, by utilization of maximum capability of GPU and NVME-SSD. Features of PG-Strom especially focus on log-data processing of large scale accumulated data like IoT/M2M area. It allows a series of data management cycle on a simple standalone database server configuration; data import, summarizing, transformation, cooperation with machine-learning application like anomaly detection, and so on. In addition to easy-to-understand effects such as system cost reduction and time reduction of massive data migration, all the operations works on PostgreSQL system that is familiar for many engineers, we can utilize existing skill and knowledge of database administration and also improve software quality of applications. PG-Strom core technologies Transparent massive-parallel SQL execution by GPU GPU Characteristics A GPU device has thousands processor cores and high performance memory bus arounds hundreds GB/s bandwidth. These hardware resources work very efficiently on parallel computing, thus GPU can offer much higher price-performance ratio than CPU. Matrix operations are a typical parallel computing workload where GPU has advantage, because of identical calculations on massive amount of uniformed data set. SQL also has similar workloads, like evaluation of WHERE-clause for each record on full table scan, for example. PG-Strom Overview PG-Strom is an extension for PostgreSQL, designed for acceleration of summarizing and analytic SQL workloads using parallel computing capability of GPUs. It supports on-GPU execution of WHERE, JOIN and GROUP BY which are CPU intensive workloads. Once PostgreSQL query optimizer chooses on-GPU execution, PG-Strom generates GPU binary code from the SQL by JIT (just-in-time) compile, then asynchronously runs on GPU in massive parallel. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL for maximum storage performance SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL, a unique technology of HeteroDB, enables to load PostgreSQL data blocks on NVME storage to GPU device directly, then executes SQL workloads prior to data load on CPU/RAM. It reduces the data size to be processed by CPU, and it is not rare that data size becomes 1/1000 or less, if GPU can handle aggregation operations with GROUP BY. Even though GPU is usually considered as a \"computing accelerator\", it can also accelerate I/O intensive SQL workloads by utilization of GPU for \"data reduction on the way of I/O bus\". Technology Basis - GPUDirect RDMA NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA is technology basis of this mechanism. It enables peer-to-peer data transfer between GPU device memory and other PCIe devices. GPUDirect RDMA is originally designed for MPI over Infiniband between GPU servers, on the other hands, we can utilize this feature on other type of PCIe devices as long as custom Linux kernel module intermediates data transfer on these devices. We applied this infrastructure for the close cooperation on NVME-SSD and GPU. Columnar data store of Apache Arrow PG-Strom supports direct read of Apache Arrow format that is used by many of data analytics applications, so it eliminates the data importing steps to DB system, and pulls out higher effective SQL processing performance more than physical limit of storage, with efficient I/O by columnar data structure. Apache Arrow is one of the columnar data format, and also a data exchange format used by many data analytics applications. So, libraries to handle Arrow format are provided for major languages like C/C++, Python and so on. Why data import is not necessary? PG-Strom allows to read Arrow files as like PostgreSQL tables using foreign-table interface, and also support SQL processing on GPU. Usually, it takes tons of time to import external data-set to the database system, prior to summarizing and analyzing. On the other hands, Arrow_Fdw of PG-Strom just maps Arrow files on foreign tables, so a simple file copy completes data import. Why efficient I/O It is not usual to reference all the columns defined at a table in the analytic workloads. Usually, it is enough to reference a part of columns, on the other words, unreferenced columns are \"junk data\" that consumes I/O bandwidth with no sense. It is hard to extract only referenced columns from row-data like PostgreSQL. In case of columnar data, we can easily control the device to read only referenced columns contrastingly, because data elements are closely disposed per column. Scalable storage by NVME-oF support It is not an easy task to estimate the required storage capacity exactly on system installation time for the systems that collect and accumulate log-data increasing day-by-day, like IoT/M2M area. If PCIe-based NVME-SSDs are installed on the server, the maximum storage capacity is restricted by the server chassis size. On the other hands, NVME-over-Fabric technology, that uses remote NVME-SSDs over extreme fast networks, allows to extend capacity of the storage on demand, regardless of the server chassis size. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL technology of PG-Strom supports NVME-oF, and allows to load data blocks from remote NVME-SSD to local GPU directly by RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Aceess) over the network cards. Proposition of use scenarios Log-data search & processing - for security In case of security incidents, log-data of IT systems or network facilities provide us a hint to find out the causation and scope of the impact. However, it is not realistic scenario to apply an generic DB tuning methodology like indexing or partitioning preliminary towards unknown attack patterns, on the other hands, cause investigation and reporting are rapidly required. PG-Strom enables fast log-search and try-&-error of hypothesis by utilization of GPU's computing power and NVME-SSD's wide bandwidth. For engineers in the field, they can use SQL statements and operators of PostgreSQL which are familiar with. Business Intelligence & Reporting Typical summarizing SQL workloads, often used for business intelligence (BI) or reporting, are suitable for parallel execution by massive CPU/GPU cores and require storage system high I/O throughput. PG-Strom is optimized to this kind of workloads, thus enables rapid summarizing with all the hardware resources like CPU, GPU and SSD. Therefore, it allows to replace legacy systems, expensive DWH appliance or cluster based systems people often adopted in the past, by simple PostgreSQL-based solution. Anomaly Detection We need to find out \u201canomaly\u201d as frequent as possible, to detect criminal transaction, like credit-card skimming or bank transfer scam, from the daily transactional records. PG-Strom supports to run anomaly detection logic based on statistical analysis algorithms directly on the transactional records stores in the database. GPU can process this logic very fast, and no need to export the database for checking because of in-database processing.

We are looking forward to see you in the conference. HeteroDB released PG-Strom products for GPU acceleration of database workloads 18-Apr-2018 (Wed) Today, HeteroDB,Inc (Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan, CEO: KaiGai Kohei) released subscription products of PG-Strom which is GPU accelerated database technology, and appliance server product with this software. PG-Strom which pull out maximum capability of the least hardware, offers DWH-class performance with 1U/2U rack server. PG-Strom is an extension module designed for PostgreSQL which is one of the most successful open source relational database management system. It automatically generates GPU programs from SQL commands, and runs SQL workloads in parallel using a few thousand cores and high-bandwidth memory of GPU, so accelerates reporting and analytics workloads to big-data. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution, a part of core features, directly loads data blocks of PostgreSQL on NVMe-SSD to GPU, then runs SQL workloads on the GPU prior to the data arrival at the host system. It enables to reduce amount of the data to be processed by CPU less than a few hundredth of the original, thus runs I/O intensive workloads like reporting queries or full-table scans much efficiently. PG-Strom is implemented on top of the internal APIs officially supported by PostgreSQL only, so it looks like a vanilla PostgreSQL system from the standpoint of users and applications. No special tuning and configurations are needed because its optimizer determines whether GPU shall be utilized according to the characteristics of the query. In addition, it can perform on transactional data (row-format) also, no need to convert the data format between transactional system and information system. By the enhancement of sufficient performance to single node PostgreSQL which is the simplest configuration, it allows to design application more and more simple, and also allows to reduce daily database administration jobs. Appliance model optimized for PG-Strom We simultaneously release an appliance server product which consists of optimal hardware components and validated as a platform of the various acceleration features of PG-Strom.

The new company will provides high performance, cost effective and well administrative database product that utilizes heterogeneous computing technology, and related solution and services. Mission of the new company We are living in an exciting period when computer architecture is rapidly evolving once per decade. The Moore's law comes closer to its termination, processor is evolved from multi-cores to many-cores, and it becomes almost impossible to improve system performance without GPU or FPGA that are designed based on a different design concept. In case of the heterogeneous computer architecture, software cannot take a \"free-lunch\" of hardware evolution. Software has to be redesigned to pull out maximum performance of the hardware. We have worked on development of \"PG-Strom\" which is an open source extension module to accelerate SQL workloads of PostgreSQL with GPU's parallel computing capability for more than 5 years. It is a quite exciting technology area from the standpoint of software developer. Plus, we have been supported by our vocation to deliver the power of heterogeneous computing that is a core of next generation computer architecture, through the database management system that widely supports human and society, and also through the eco-system of open source software. HeteroDB,Inc we established today has the following three missions. To provide high-performance, cost-effective and well-administrative data processing platform, by the database product that embeds heterogeneous computing technology like PG-Strom. To be a professional on both of GPU and database; different technology areas, and to lead an optimal solution based on the insight to customer's problem.

It automatically generates GPU programs from SQL commands, and runs SQL workloads in parallel using a few thousand cores and high-bandwidth memory of GPU, so accelerates reporting and analytics workloads to big-data. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution, a part of core features, directly loads data blocks of PostgreSQL on NVMe-SSD to GPU, then runs SQL workloads on the GPU prior to the data arrival at the host system. It enables to reduce amount of the data to be processed by CPU less than a few hundredth of the original, thus runs I/O intensive workloads like reporting queries or full-table scans much efficiently. PG-Strom is implemented on top of the internal APIs officially supported by PostgreSQL only, so it looks like a vanilla PostgreSQL system from the standpoint of users and applications. No special tuning and configurations are needed because its optimizer determines whether GPU shall be utilized according to the characteristics of the query. In addition, it can perform on transactional data (row-format) also, no need to convert the data format between transactional system and information system. By the enhancement of sufficient performance to single node PostgreSQL which is the simplest configuration, it allows to design application more and more simple, and also allows to reduce daily database administration jobs.","title":"PG-Strom which pull out maximum capability of the least hardware, offers DWH-class performance with 1U/2U rack server."},{"location":"release/#appliance-model-optimized-for-pg-strom","text":"We simultaneously release an appliance server product which consists of optimal hardware components and validated as a platform of the various acceleration features of PG-Strom.

The Moore's law comes closer to its termination, processor is evolved from multi-cores to many-cores, and it becomes almost impossible to improve system performance without GPU or FPGA that are designed based on a different design concept. In case of the heterogeneous computer architecture, software cannot take a \"free-lunch\" of hardware evolution. Software has to be redesigned to pull out maximum performance of the hardware. We have worked on development of \"PG-Strom\" which is an open source extension module to accelerate SQL workloads of PostgreSQL with GPU's parallel computing capability for more than 5 years. It is a quite exciting technology area from the standpoint of software developer. Plus, we have been supported by our vocation to deliver the power of heterogeneous computing that is a core of next generation computer architecture, through the database management system that widely supports human and society, and also through the eco-system of open source software. HeteroDB,Inc we established today has the following three missions. To provide high-performance, cost-effective and well-administrative data processing platform, by the database product that embeds heterogeneous computing technology like PG-Strom. To be a professional on both of GPU and database; different technology areas, and to lead an optimal solution based on the insight to customer's problem. To contribute growth of eco-system of the open source community beyond companies, nations and technology areas, and to make our widespread innovation to the upstream.

Then, we will propose an optimal approach to accelerate the problematic workloads from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness, project period and so on. Step-1: Analysis of the workloads, diagnosis, and proposition of measures We analyze customer's workloads, then make a diagnosis why problematic queries got slow-down. Based on the diagnosis, we shall propose an optimal way to accelerate the problematic workloads from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness, project period and so on. Step-2: Improvement by PostgreSQL parameters and system configuration We propose reasonable configuration parameters of PostgreSQL and operating system configuration around storage system, prior to individual query optimization. These configuration can cause inefficient query plan generation or extremely less utilization ratio of CPU or I/O, so it needs reasonable configuration according to the system scale and workloads characteristics. Step-3: Tuning by data structure revising and query rewrites Our professional engineer applied fundamental database tuning like data structure revising or query rewrites. In batch or analytic queries, it is not rare that inadequate query execution plan by wrong query optimization leads 100 times, often 10000 times, slower query execution performance than the optimal grade. User case X-company is dissatisfied with batch query slow-down on terabytes scale database, and they considered a high-end DB product like Oracle Exadata, AWS RedShift and so on. HeteroDB also had a chance to introduce PG-Strom for them. However, according to their explanation, it looks to us the problem comes from inadequate data structure and inefficient query execution plan, rather than the performance of query execution engine. So, we proposed our database tuning service instead of the product. By the result of a week investigation, it became clear that inefficient index usage and wrong query execution performance. Eventually, we pulled up the database performance by applying PostgreSQL v11 partitions and individual query tuning. Rather than adoption of a high-end DB product, the entire DB system performance could be improved to a level where it was able to consider reducint the DB instance size. R&D Support Service We support research & development missions, at the technology area where we have experienced: PostgreSQL database, Linux operating system, GPU computing (NVIDIA, CUDA C), and related areas. Customer case Y-company, develops a next-generation data processing solution, considers to utilize NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA for peer-to-peer data transfer system between a device and GPU, CPU bypassed. They invited us to the project, because HeteroDB has been well experienced in this region by the development of SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL of PG-Strom. In the project, we had provided comments and propositions for use of GPUDirect RDMA, hints to pull out its performance, advices and hypothesis on trouble shooting from the technology standpoint. Then, the project can be closed with expected performance in two months. GPU Software Development Our professional engineers who are experienced in GPU, CUDA C and parallel computing support GPU software development.
